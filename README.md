# Moving checkbox
This plugin makes it easy to move an unfinished tasks to the following day. The task's checkbox will be checked and copied to the daily note of the next, unchecked. 

This is very useful if you use the [Obsidian Daily notes](https://help.obsidian.md/Plugins/Daily+notes) plugin for keeping track if your todo's. It's not function completely like a [Bullet Journal](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bullet_journal), but it tries to get as close as possible. Key feature is for example that if your checkbox needs to be moved to the next day, you can presume that it is not finished. In a bullet journal you would ear tag the task with a special character to show what you have done with the bullet (task). In this first version, you can set a costume checkbox character, the plugin default is a greater than sign `>` for showing that it moved. By _not_ using the markdown default `x`, the task text is not crossed out.

For future updated it is that intension to add more Bullet journal features to make keeping track of what you've been doing and done more fun and easier.
